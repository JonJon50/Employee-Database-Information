 **Hello World üëã**

* School can be very demanding, with so much information. That leads us to multitask, which can contribute to missing valuable tasks.  Inspiring me as well as motivating me to create a Note Taker!
* By doing so this easy-to-use app will help manage your day-to-day life. 
* When laying out notes and setting reminders can help you be more proficient with minimum stress.
* Diving into this project has taught me a few skills along the way. 
1. Implementing Express.js 
2. Retrieving and saving data from JSON
3. Deployment to Heroku and **so much more**.
